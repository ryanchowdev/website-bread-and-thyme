                    <p>
                        Emily Foster's passion for baking was sparked in her grandmother's kitchen, 
                        where the aroma of freshly baked bread mingled with stories of old-world 
                        baking traditions. Growing up, Emily spent countless hours by her grandmother's 
                        side, learning the art of kneading dough and crafting artisanal bread with love 
                        and care. Her grandmother's tales of family recipes and baking techniques from 
                        a bygone era inspired Emily to dream of opening her own bakery one day. After 
                        years of working in the corporate world, Emily realized that her heart belonged 
                        in the kitchen, and she was determined to turn her passion into a reality.

        <!-- Brief history -->
        <div class="container" id="history">
            <h2 class="aboreto-bold">The Vision</h2>
            <p>
                Bread & Thyme was more than just a business venture; it was a place where tradition met innovation. 
                The bakery's philosophy was simple: use the finest ingredients, bake with love, and create a warm, 
                welcoming atmosphere for everyone who walked through the door. The centerpiece of their offerings 
                was the sourdough bread, baked fresh every morning. Emily's grandmother's recipe, with a touch of 
                Jacob's secret blend of herbs, quickly became a local favorite. Alongside the bread, they offered 
                a variety of pastries, each with a unique twist reflecting Jacob's culinary adventures. 
                As Bread & Thyme flourished, Emily and Jacob expanded their menu with artisanal sandwiches and 
                seasonal specials, delighting customers and establishing the bakery as a go-to destination for food enthusiasts.
            </p>
            <h2 class="aboreto-bold">Community and Sustainability</h2>
            <p>
                From the outset, Bread & Thyme committed to sustainability and supporting local farmers. They sourced 
                their flour from a nearby organic farm and used seasonal produce for their fillings and toppings, 
                ensuring freshness and strengthening community bonds. Emily and Jacob's dedication to sustainable 
                practices extended to eco-friendly packaging and encouraging customers to bring their own containers. 
                Additionally, they hosted popular baking classes and workshops, fostering a sense of community and 
                inspiring a new generation of bakers. This commitment to sustainability and community-centered activities 
                further solidified Bread & Thyme's reputation as a beloved local establishment.
